## What AI Literacy Means

AI literacy is understanding how LLMs actually work—not the technical details, but their fundamental nature: they're pattern-matching systems trained on human text, not reasoning engines with true understanding. Being AI literate means knowing:

- **What they're good at**: Pattern recognition, synthesis, structured formatting, generating variations, working with clear specifications
- **What they struggle with**: Multi-step reasoning without guidance, maintaining consistency across long conversations, knowing what they don't know
- **How to communicate effectively**: Being specific, providing examples, breaking complex tasks into steps

## Thinking Together with LLMs

The key is **complementary collaboration**—you each do what you're best at:

**What human brains do better:**
- **Strategic thinking**: Setting goals, understanding context and implications
- **Judgment**: Evaluating quality, relevance, appropriateness
- **Real-world grounding**: Understanding nuance, unstated assumptions, social context
- **Creative direction**: Knowing what "good" looks like for subjective work
- **Verification**: Checking facts, logic, and coherence
- **Long-term coherence**: You maintain the overall vision and consistency across a project

**About "context windows"**: Interestingly, LLMs technically have *longer* immediate context windows (I can "see" this entire conversation at once), but humans have better **long-term memory architecture**. You integrate experiences over years, retrieve relevant memories flexibly, and maintain consistent models of the world. I process what's in front of me but don't truly "remember" previous conversations without retrieval tools.

## Organizing Your LLM Interactions

**For ongoing work:**
- **Use the project feature** (if available) to maintain context across conversations
- **Create templates** for recurring tasks—save effective prompts
- **Build a "prompt library"** for your common needs
- **Iterate progressively**: Start broad, then refine with follow-ups rather than trying to perfect the first prompt

**Prompt architecture patterns:**
- **Role + Task + Constraints**: "You're a technical editor. Review this for clarity. Keep the tone conversational."
- **Examples**: Show 2-3 examples of what you want
- **Format specifications**: "Provide output as a numbered list" or "use this template"
- **Thinking steps**: "First analyze X, then consider Y, finally recommend Z"

**Reusable prompt components:**
- Style guides you reference repeatedly
- Output format templates
- Quality criteria checklists
- Domain-specific context you can prepend

## Becoming AI Fluent

**Fluency develops through:**

1. **Experimentation**: Try different phrasings and see what works
2. **Iterative refinement**: Treat it like a conversation, not a one-shot query
3. **Meta-prompting**: Ask "How should I phrase this request?" when stuck
4. **Understanding failure modes**: When output is wrong, figure out *why* (ambiguous prompt? Missing context? Task beyond capability?)
5. **Calibration**: Learn when to trust output vs. verify carefully

**The fluent workflow:**
- You provide direction, context, and constraints
- AI generates options and structure
- You evaluate, select, and refine
- Iterate until it meets your standards
- You verify correctness and apply judgment

Think of it less like "asking questions" and more like **delegating to a very capable but somewhat literal assistant** who needs clear direction but can execute quickly once they understand what you want.
